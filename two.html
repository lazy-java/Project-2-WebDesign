        <h3>Ubisoft</h3>

        <p>A Gaming Platform is a market where one can access video games, whether those games are free or for money.
        </p>

        <p>Ubisoft is one of the Big 3 when it comes to Gaming Platforms, Ubisoft has existed for quite some time and made some
            honorable games, such as the Assassin's Creed Series, Tom Clancy Rainbow Six Siege and other Tom Clancy games, alongside For Honor,
            Far Cry, Watch Dogs and The Crew.
        </p>
        <p>Ubisoft offers a variety of video games, with thing's such as in-game rewards where you can level up your Ubisoft
            account and earn points and spend them on in-game items.

        <h3>Epic Games</h3>

        <p>Epic Games is one of the most used gaming platform with over thousands of games supported by it. Epic Games frequently gives away 
            games for free, or low prices with really good sales with some at even 80% off.
        </p>
        <p>I personally prefer not to use Epic Games as much as i can since the launcher takes considerably longer to launch compared to other launchers and I don't really 
            like navigating through the application.
        </p>
        <p>One of the most popular games Epic has to offer is the one and only Fortnite, this game was super popular from 2017 to 2021, with thousands of users playing consistently daily. 
            It also offers other games such as Fall Guys, Fallout, Rogue Company, RocketLeague and around 500 more games.
        </p>

        <img class="steamimg" src ="/Users/KHOKHHAS000/Desktop/school work/Web Design/Second Project/steam.jpg" alt="Steam">
        <h3>Steam</h3>
        <p>Steam is the biggest gaming platform ever, it offers thousands of games, many of which that are free. I personally love using steam since its easy to navigate, loads up pretty quick
            gives out huge sales super often, with many deals being from 25% to 75% and on some special occassions even 90% off. When such sales come up, I tend to buy as many games as I can that I
            know i'd be playing in the future. 
        </p>
        <p>Some of the Major Games Steam offers are Csgo and now CS 2, Hogwarts Legacy, Starfield, Skyrim, Apex, The Witcher, Resident Evil Series, Dead By Daylight, Left 4 Dead 2.
            If possible I tend to get games on Steam rather than any other platform.
