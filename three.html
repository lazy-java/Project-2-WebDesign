        <h3>Racing Games</h3>

        <p>There's many Racing games that sore to the top over the years, the ones the lasted the longest 
            reign supreme over the rest, though the occasional new video game that becomes popular for a little while before everyone
        goes back to the main racing games.</p>
        <p>Among the top Racing Games, those that stand out are RocketLeague, Assetto Corsa, Need for Speed and the driving aspect of
            Gta.

        <h3>FPS Games</h3>

        <p>There's many FPS Games (first person shooter) that have stood out over the years, among those PubG was very popular a couple years back
            but then ended up dying in popularity because people got bored of it since it didn't really have any new aspects to it, there was only
            so much the developers could do in a game with no special abilities.
        </p>
        <p> The Call of Duty Franchise is one of the biggest video game Franchises ever ranging over several versions of the game, some have zombie modes, while others have 
            free for all, death-match and other exclusive modes. 
            Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege, Csgo and Apex are other Very Popular Fps Games.

        <h3>Story Games</h3>

        <p>There are many story based games that have come out over the years, the ones that stood out the most are games such as the Assassin Creed Franchise
            known for it's beautiful graphics and plot. I personally love the series since you get a super interesting story with plot twists that often occur and get to see
            character development of your character and also how the story unfolds. In my opinion I loved Assassin Creed Rogue the most since i have nostalgic views on it.
            Hogwarts Legacy, Elden Ring and Uncharted are some honorable mentions regarding this genre.
