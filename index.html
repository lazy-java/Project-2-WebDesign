    <h3>PlayStation 5</h3>
    <p>For ages people have always debated over what's better, Console or Pc.
    I'm going to delve into the depths of the situation and figure out once and for all which device is better. </p>

    <p>On the right, we have a PS5, most of the time when people compare devices, they usually compare Xbox  with Ps5. 
        Each Device has its own perks, with different video games, personalization, social access, different controllers and different graphics.</p>

    <p>I personally prefer the PS5 over the Xbox, many agree while others disagree. I like the way the console looks and how easy it is to use a ps5 controller over an Xbox controller.
        As someone who has owned an Xbox before, the controller sticks feel more rigid and get damaged faster than a PS5's</p>

    <h3>  Xbox Series X</h3>

    <p>Xbox has many advantages to it that distincts itself from PS5, one of the most popular games Fifa, had characters called legends
        that were only available on Xbox, though this was countered a couple years ago with icons. </p>
        <p>Another benefit to Xbox would be their deals such as Xbox gamepass which allows
             you to pay a subscription fee for a vast majority of games.</p>
    </p>

    <p>The controller for Xbox is different compared to the Playstation with a few distinct features, the main ones being
        the location of the left analog stick and the buttons on the right being letters rather than shapes.
    </p>
    <p> One last thing that i would like to add is the names for their buttons are different compared to playstation such as R2 being rather
        and the feel of the buttons and analog stick is more rigid and less smooth.

    <h3>Why PC is Better Than All Consoles</h3>
    <p>PC outperforms consoles in almost every single aspect, Having a keyboard supplies you with more key options for video games,
        having a mouse makes it so you can aim more accurately and swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>In terms of Which one is better regarding graphics and processing speed, it isn't even a contest. Up until a while back consoles were
        stuck on 60 frames per second, while pc could have unlimited. Having more frames per second shows that the processing speed is faster and more capable
        it also allows for a smoother gaming experience. Pc players also have the option to many more games and a large variety of design and customization.
    </p>
    <p>They can even have higher graphics which allows for a more beautiful game and enjoyable time. At the same time you can have multiple apps open
        and some PCs' being able to even run multiple games at once so you can maximize your enjoyment, such as having music or a video playing in the background.
